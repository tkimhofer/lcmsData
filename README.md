`lcmsData` is a data-only R package providing LC‑MS level 1 reference data. The data represents a human urine sample analyzed within a larger analytical run using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for pre-separation, followed by electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode and detection with a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q‑TOF) mass spectrometer. This experimental data set is designed for developing and benchmarking feature-detection and pre-processing algorithms in high-throughput metabolic profiling.

## Data objects

| object         | description                                                                                                                                                                                              | format       |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `lcms`        | Raw UPLC‑MS level‑1 scan data acquired with HILIC‑ESI+ Q‑TOF MS.  The data frame contains around 11.9 million rows with variables for mass‑to‑charge ratio (`mz`), detector counts (`count`), scan identifier (`scanId`) and scan time (`scantime`). | data.frame  |
| `hilicPosUrine` | An [`xcmsRaw`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/xcms) object from the same experiment.  It is generated by reading the raw profile file (`Urine_HILIC_ESIpos_msLevel1.mzML`) with `xcmsRaw(..., profstep = 0, includeMSn = FALSE, mslevel = 1)`. | xcmsRaw     |

## Installation

You can install the package from GitHub using `remotes`:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tkimhofer/lcmsData")
```

## Usage
Load the package and data objects as follows:
``` r
library(lcmsData)

# raw scan data (data frame)
data(lcms)
str(lcms)

# xcms object
data(hilicPosUrine)
hilicPosUrine
```
`lcmsdata` can be used to test feature detection, retention‑time correction and other pre‑processing steps. The `hilicPosUrine` object is convenient for workflows based on the xcms Bioconductor package.
