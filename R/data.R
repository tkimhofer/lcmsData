#' UPLC-MS data for metabolic profiling
#'
#' A dataset containing raw UPLC-MS level 1 data.
#' Data were acquired using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to electrospray (ESI) quadrupole - time of flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a multi-channel plate detector. ESI was performed in positive ionisation mode.
